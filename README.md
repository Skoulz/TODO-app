# TODO-app

TASK:
* TODO application 

Grading 70% will be given for a functional CRUD implemented with the following functionality:

Add task, delete task, edit task, also creation and deletion date should be saved.

For full 100% extra effort will be required - some ideas could be: search/filter for tasks, add recorded audio note to task(how about calling transcription API to to speech-to-text?),take picture for the task, perform backup on cloud based db (Firebase is one good option).

Maybe allow multiple users - (not sure how practical it would be on a mobile phone)

You do not have to add everything, just something "extra".
